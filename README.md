   ## 🗣️ About
   
  > _The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program
using UNIX signals._

You must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.

## Getting started
**Follow the steps below**
```bash
# Clone the project and access the folder
git clone https://github.com/nandajfa/minitalk.git && cd minitalk/

# Compile minitalk
make

# First you launch server:
$ ./server
Server will print its PID and wait

# So you use the client to send string or unicode characters to the server
$ ./client PID_SERVER STRING

# Clean output objects with
make fclean

# Well done!
```
